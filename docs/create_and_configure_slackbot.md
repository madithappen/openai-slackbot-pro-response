# Create and Configure the Pro Resposne Slackbot
Here are the steps to create a slackbot that integrates with the script provided, using the official Slack documentation:

1. Create a Slack workspace and a bot user for your slackbot. You can do this by following the instructions here: https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#bot_users

2. Set up the bot user's permissions and OAuth scopes. You will need the `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `channels:write`, `chat:write`, and `groups:history` scopes to allow the bot to read and write messages in channels and groups. You can do this by following the instructions here: https://api.slack.com/authentication/scopes-resources#available_scopes

3. Get the bot's `API token` and `channel ID`. You will need these to initialize the SlackAPI object in the script. You can find the `API token` in the bot user's OAuth & Permissions page, and the `channel ID` in the URL of the channel or group that you want the bot to operate in.

4. Set up the OpenAI API key. You will need to sign up for an OpenAI API key and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to the key. You can find instructions on how to do this here: https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart

5. Set up the environment variables in a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables to it:
    ```bash
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your slack bot token>
    SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=<your slack channel id>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>
    SERVICE_IP=<the ip address of your server>
    SERVICE_PORT=<the port number of your server>
    ```

6. Install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. Run the script. You can run the script by using the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will start the slackbot web service, which will listen for incoming requests to the /pr and /prr endpoints.

8. Set up the slackbot to listen for events. You can set up the slackbot to listen for events such as messages in channels or groups, or direct messages to the bot user, by using the Slack Events API. You will need to set up a request URL and register it with Slack to receive events. You can do this by following the instructions here: https://api.slack.com/events/api/getting-started

9. Respond to events. Once you have set up the slackbot to listen for events, you can add code to the script to handle the events and respond appropriately. You can use the Slack WebClient API to send messages, interact with the Slack API, or perform other actions in response to events. You can find more information on using the Slack WebClient API here: https://api.slack.com/client/basics


> Note that you may need to modify the script to fit your specific use case. You may also need to set up a server or hosting platform to run the script, depending on your requirements.
